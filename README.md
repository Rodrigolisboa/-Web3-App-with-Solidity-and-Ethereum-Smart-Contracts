# Build a Web3 App with Solidity + Ethereum Smart Contracts

Based on a BuildSpace project where I learned some Solidity, wrote and deployed a smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain (Rinkeby testnet), and built a Web3 client app to interact with my contract.

Web3 client app available at https://waveportal-starter-project.rodrigolisboa2.repl.co/
